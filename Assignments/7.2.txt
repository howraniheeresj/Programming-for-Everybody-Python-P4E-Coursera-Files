7.2 Write a program that prompts for a file name, 
then opens that file and reads through the file, 
looking for lines of the form:

X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475

Count these lines and extract the floating point 
values from each of the lines and compute the 
average of those values and produce an output as 
shown below.

You can download the sample data 
at http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/mbox-short.txt 
when you are testing below enter mbox-short.txt 
as the file name.





# Use the file name mbox-short.txt as the file name
fname = raw_input("Enter file name: ")
fh = open(fname)
hw = 0
ag = 0
for line in fh:
	if not line.startswith("X-DSPAM-Confidence:"): continue
	pt = line.find(':')
	nw = float(line[pt+1:])
	hw = float(hw + 1)
	ag = ag + nw
print "Average spam confidence:", ag/hw
