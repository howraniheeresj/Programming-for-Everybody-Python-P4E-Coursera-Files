10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt 
and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for 
each of the messages. You can pull the hour out from the 
'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the 
string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print 
out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below. Note that 
the autograder does not have support for the sorted() 
function.



name = raw_input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
counts = dict()

for line in handle:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if not line.startswith("From"): continue
    words = line.split()
    if len(words)<5: continue
    time = words[5]
    hours = time.split(":")
    hour = hours[0]
    counts[hour] = counts.get(hour,0) + 1

lst = list()
for k, v in counts.items():
	lst.append((k,v))

lst.sort()

for k, v in lst:
    print k, v
