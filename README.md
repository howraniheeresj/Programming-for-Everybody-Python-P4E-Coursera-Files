# Programming-for-Everybody-Python---Coursera-Files

This repository contains the files used during the Coursera's Course Programming for Everybody (P4E), 
by Dr. Chuck from the University of Michigan.

These are my solutions for the class exercises and has also the solutions for the book, separated in chapters.
Any suggestions are welcome!
